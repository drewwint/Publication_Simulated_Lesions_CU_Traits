# Publication: Computatationally Simulated Lesions and Callous-Unemotional Traits
This is the repository for a project in progress where we computationally simulated lesions across individual-level functoinal connectoms in relation to CU traits.

Here you will find analysis code as well as masks used for meta-analysis. 

Note the mask is in the "Mask" folder

The data we used is open-source and can be obtained through the 1000 connectomes project under the Nathan Kline Institutes Rockland Dataset
