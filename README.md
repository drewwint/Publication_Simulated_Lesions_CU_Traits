# Publication: Computatationally Simulated Lesions and Callous-Unemotional Traits
This repository contains the code and brain mask for computationally simulating lesions across individual-level functoinal connectoms in relation to CU traits.

Here you will find analysis code as well as the mask used for meta-analysis that could be used with your fMRI data to attempt to replicate prediction of CU traits. 

You can find the preprint for this project on [biorxive](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.07.511379). If you find this material useful and/or use the mask or portions of the code - [please cite this publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.07.511379).

*NOTE* for the atlases used in this study you will have to download the default atlases from the [CONN Toolbox](https://web.conn-toolbox.org/).
Specificaly you will need the atlas.nii and networks.nii files from CONN to replicate the parcelation used.
